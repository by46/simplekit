Installation
==================

System-Wide Installation
--------------------------------

This is possible as well, though I do not recommend it. Just run pip with root privileges ::

    $ pip install --trusted-host scmesos06 -i http://scmesos06/simple simplekit

(On Windows systems, run it in a command-prompt window with administrator privileges, and leave out sudo.)
