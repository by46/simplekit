Welcome to Simple Kit
===================

The SimpleKit is a collection of utility function for Python, include some mostly useful
function. Python provide some useful packages and modules, but some of those is too
complicated to used. for example,  the package ``json`` is used to serialize and deserialize
 json object.  ``json.loads(s)`` return dict object which represent the json object, I
 think the ``[key]`` operator, especially the json object contains hierarchical project.
 So, SimpleKit provides some simple and brief way which operate the object object.
